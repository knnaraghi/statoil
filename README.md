# Statoil Kaggle Competition

This repository contains files for the Statoil Kaggle competition. You will have to download the [training and test set](https://www.kaggle.com/c/statoil-iceberg-classifier-challenge/data). 

The default model to use is vgg16 but can be edited to the other supported models in transfer_model. If finetuning is set to true in train.py, make sure to edit the paramaters to match the model architecture. 

Thanks to all the numerous Kaggle contributors who I have learned from and incorporated various aspects of their work.
